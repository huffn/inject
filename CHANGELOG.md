#### Bug Fixes

* lscache was referenced as `cache` in InjectContext.env but communicator.js wasn' ([fe8e57ec](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/fe8e57ecf5eec24dc764207b1a0a1ee8f7e97b94))
* **Communicator:** Makes use of lscache object in this.env ([b1bedd3f](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/b1bedd3f176ac11540d934534c92deb6bc8d35f0), closes [#306](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/issues/306))

### v0.7.0-rc1 (2014-02-28)


#### Bug Fixes

* **Communicator:** communicator now only uses iframe when cross domain ([3907e556](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/3907e556d1b27222426a55026bd33d786140bf97))
* **grunt:**
  * use native trim ([1aa45f7b](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/1aa45f7bb09541ea55023e99769d649743e6630a))
  * Reincludes the qunit commands ([8dd5dd4e](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/8dd5dd4e838ca3e256c2cccd8a249b760a2e0d72))


#### Features

* **Core:** Allows for multiple instances of Inject ([4ee4af1d](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/4ee4af1d6248990fb6a88e6e74da88b0f52d7754))
* **grunt:** adds a release task check to ensure the branch is master ([d568538a](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/d568538a3414f10fe5144ba799893d6437f27c9b))


#### Breaking Changes

* If you had logic that was depending on the iframe existing, then it may not
always be available. Making a cross domain request will establish the iframe.

<a name="v0.6.0-rc1"></a>
### v0.6.0-rc1 (2013-12-02)

#### Breaking Changes
* easyXDM has been removed from the Inject builds as of 0.6.0. As a result, IE7 requires the external inclusion of easyXDM as a Fetch Rule in order to function. This is done to reduce the total library size for the majority of users. 0.6.0 final will come with instructions for how to bring easyXDM in CORS mode for IE7 support if required.

#### Bug Fixes

* **server.js:** Inject examples now served using /recent ([ce8575ea](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/ce8575ea5a85873bb47f39b9c16eeff65bc8ddf0))
* **Tests, AMD:Plugins** Fixes normalize to use a proper ID ([79568334](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/79568334fc4b0bc12556c143b6ce3d8219d0d442))
* **RequireContext, TreeRunner** Improve handling of inline AMD ([ba85df40](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/ba85df40b78e9dcbe2be54f2d1906114d1eefdc7))

  * Creates grunt release task ([5504b7fa](http://github.com/linkedin/inject/commit/5504b7fa42b08aac02e789f6e8c908007663fdd9))

### 0.5.2 (2013-11-05)

#### Bug Fixes
* **security**: A security issue that affects the inclusion of relay.swf from relay.html has been closed. Users who did not keep their relay.html and relay.swf files in the same directory will need to remediate using the following strategy: the new relay.html file contains a `ALTERNATE_SWF_LOCATION` parameter, which can be used to specify the location of the SWF file. This will need to be done as part of the upgrade of the relay files are in different locations.

<a name="v0.5.1"></a>
### 0.5.1 (2013-10-28)

* \#258 Stack traces are improved when JS errors are encounted

<a name="v0.5.0"></a>
## 0.5.0 (2013-08-05)

#### Breaking Changes
* \#246 **pointcuts.before and pointcuts.after are removed:** Instead of using the before/after pointcuts, we encourage the use of the new addRule replacement methods. The afterFetch pointcut is still supported, although addRule itself is now deprecated. We encourage everyone to move to the new addXXRule methods.

#### Bug Fixes
* \#255 setExpires(0) was treated as "always cache" instead of "never cache"
* \#256 CSS plugin attaches properly in IE7

#### New Features
* \#254 **new rules to replace addRule:** addModuleRule, addFileRule, addContentRule, addFetchRule, addPackage. This collection of rules gives the developer much greater control of the loading system, allowing any or many parts of the module loader to be circumvented. Additionally, packages can be regstered globally using addPackage.
* \#244 **run Inject alongside script tags:** Unlike traditional AMD loaders, you are able to run Inject alongside code that checks for define and define.amd. A new method Inject.setGlobalAMD(false) allows the global define.amd to be disabled. The define.amd variable will still be available within the sandbox context. This is an incredibly useful feature if you have both script tags and Inject on your page.
* \#217 **remote localStorage:** to improve security, when using a CDN, the remote localStorage location will be used as opposed to the primary hosting domain. This frees up the main URLs localStorage for other storage operations.
* \#213 Bower Support available as the package "inject"
* \#254 addRule is now deprecated
* \#248 "grunt release" available for creating the release .tgz file
